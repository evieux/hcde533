          <div class="service-item-text">For this assignment, I chose hexagon as the only base geometry to create a press-fit kit, 
            without using others like octagons in the last assignment.</div>
          <img src="./assets/images/assignment-2-1.png" loading="lazy">
           <div class="service-item-text">I utilized Grasshopper to create the desired model, and I used the polygon definition with 
             6 segments and radius 1 to create 30+ hexagons that can fit into my cardboard.</div><br>
            <div class="service-item-text">Here is the grasshopper model for my hexagon kit. Some inputs, such as the slots' depth, 
              thickness, and angle, can be easily controlled. I can also easily modify the polygon inputs, such as the overall size, 
              the number of segments, and the fillet radius. I also add radians for the polygon to control the overall angles in case 
              of further use. I set 0 degrees for this hexagon, and I found if I set the segment to 4, which is the square would not 
              be horizontal, and this radians component could help fix the degree.</div>
           <img src="./assets/images/assignment-2-7.png" loading="lazy">
          <div class="service-item-text">When setting the laser print, I forgot to change the default horizontal and vertical piece size, 
            so the laser didnâ€™t entirely cut all the pieces I wanted. I did a second run to cut the rest pieces.</div>

           <div class="service-item-text">The thickness of the cardboard I used is 0.117" measured by the caliper. To make a relatively tight fit between two pieces 
             pressed together, I chose the slot width to be 0.1". (The kit I made for last assignment had very loose fit after using the cardboard thickness as the slot width.)</div>

           <div class="service-item-text">On the laser cutter, I used the following settings: speed 30, power 100, freq 50.</div>
