          <div class="service-item-text">This cute little polar bear named Kumaty was created by katman29. He made a whole collection of 
            polar bears and shared them on Thingiverse (<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/takman29/designs">polar bears</a>). 
            I selected this polar bear because it is the original one, and easier for me to add accessories. </div>

            <div class="service-item-text">I then went to find some cute accessories for Kumaty. The winter is coming, so I decided to choose a Santa hat 
            for Kumaty, which I found it on Thingiverse too. I hope Kumaty will like it!</div>

            <div class="service-item-text">The following picture is KUMATY in Rhino. The original file is a closed mesh, so I don’t need to reduce the 
              mesh.</div>

           <div class="service-item-text">I then imported the Santa hat into Rhino. It is also a closed mesh. However, as the picture shows, the hat size is too 
             large to fit Kumaty's head, so I scaled it down to 0.3 of the original size.</div>

           <div class="service-item-text">Then I used the command “QuadRemesh” to convert them to become the closed SubD type. And I used "booleanUnion"
             to create a closed solid polysurface polar bear with a Santa hat!</div>

           <div class="service-item-text">Part 2: Getting started with lamps</div>
           <div class="service-item-text">I got plenty of ideas for designing my lamp, so I need to narrow it down first by setting some restrictions on it.
             First, I choose to design a table lamp rather than a hanging lamp, and which means I need to design a lamp support to allow the lamp innerd stand 
             inside of it. Second, I noticed the plug and the lamp innerd couldn't disassemble. So to ensure the support can tightly fit the lamp 
             innerd, I need to make the support can be separate and piece them together later without a gap.
