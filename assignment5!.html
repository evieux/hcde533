         <div class="service-item-text">The final look of the lamp</div><br>
          <img src="./assets/images/assignment-5b-1.png" loading="lazy">
          <div class="service-item-text">After consideration of 3D printing time and space limitations, I decided to choose the version where the bulb 
            is installed at the bottom and points upwards.</div>
            <img src="./assets/images/assignment-5-11.png" loading="lazy">
            <div class="service-item-text">The inspiration I got is an exquisite and elegant lighthouse lamp on Etsy 
           that is made of concrete.</div>       
         
           <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Measurements</div>
           <div class="service-item-text">The diameter of the lamp innered is 37.22mm measured by the caliper. I went to Westlake Ace Hardware to buy the 
          smallest light bulb that I can. (height: 55.50mm, width: 35.00mm) The size of the light bulb will effect the height and width of the body of the 
             lighthouse.</div>
           <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Lamp body</div>
           <div class="service-item-text">I first created the light bulb holder based on the lamp innered and light bulb measurement. It helps me to decide 
             the inside space of the lamp body, top, and base.</div>
          <div class="service-item-text">Then I created a truncated cone as the lamp body with a large arched door. I moved the holder back almost to touch 
            the back inside the lamp body to ensure the front had enough space to shed light.</div>
          <div class="service-item-text">To make the light bulb easily attachable and removable, I added a vertical opening on the holder. It provided 
            excellent flexibility when assembling the light bulb and its cord.</div>
          <div class="service-item-text">I made a hole for the cord to go through the back of the lamp body, which is also an arched door, for aesthetic 
            consistency.</div>
          <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Lamp base</div>
          <div class="service-item-text">The base of the lamp is printed together with the holder. To make the bottom and the body can be joined together 
            successfully without any fasteners. I made a ring joint so the body can mount onto the base.</div>
          <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Lamp top</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">The base of the lamp is printed together with the holder. To make the bottom and the body can be joined together 
            successfully without any fasteners. I made a ring joint so the body can mount onto the base.</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">I made a castle-like top to give the lighthouse style. Adding a ring slot at the bottom of the castle makes the 
           body and the top can be mounted together.</div>
