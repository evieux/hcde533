         <div class="service-item-text">The final look of molds</div><br>

         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Inspiration</div>
          <div class="service-item-text">For the molding and casting assignment, I found this cute apple model on Thingiverse and I thought it is a great 
            choice to start to practice making a mold.</div>     
         
           <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Mesh work</div>
           <div class="service-item-text">The object I imported into Rhino is an open mesh. I reduced the polygons from 10232 to 4000 to make the mesh to be closed.</div>
          <img src="./assets/images/assignment-6-2.png" loading="lazy">
          
         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Angle</div>
           <div class="service-item-text">I used the command DraftAngleAnalysis and added the mid draft curve to view the balance of it. I made an open 
             extrusionÂ to try to split the objects later.</div>
         <img src="./assets/images/assignment-6-3.png" loading="lazy">
         
         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Vents</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">I then added a main intake vent and a small vent using the truncated cones.</div>
         <img src="./assets/images/assignment-6-4.png" loading="lazy">
         
         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Registration points</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">I also added 4 registration points using the command Sphere.</div>
         <img src="./assets/images/assignment-6-5.png" loading="lazy">
         
         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Split work</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">I used the command MeshBooleanSplit to split the apple, vents, and registration points.</div>
         <img src="./assets/images/assignment-6-6.png" loading="lazy">
         
         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Add boxes</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">I flipped the bottom objects and added boxes for both two groups. I made a thicker bottom for 
            the box to avoid distortion of the later molds.</div>
         <img src="./assets/images/assignment-6-7.png" loading="lazy">
         <img src="./assets/images/assignment-6-8.png" loading="lazy">
         
         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">3D print the molds-for-molds</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">I printed with low quality settings and 10% infill to speed up the printing time. The result is 
         10% infill is not bad! I saved around 1 hour and the structure seems solid! The overall print time for two boxes is 7hours 45mins.
         I was worried about letting the printer work it over night but it seems ok.</div>
         <img src="./assets/images/assignment-6-9.png" loading="lazy">
         
         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Oomoo mixing</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">Mixing the Oomoo is the easy part of the whole work. I didn't found any clear cups so I marked the 
         water line to ensure I have two equal amount of components. I then mixed them together throughtly around 4 mins.</div>

         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Oomoo filling</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">I poured the mixed Oomoo into the boxes slowly while using cutlery to remove the small bubbles.</div>
         <img src="./assets/images/assignment-6-12.png" loading="lazy">
         
         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Release the molds</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">After 6 hours patient waiting, I can finally release the molds! It suprised me that the Oomoo is really
         hard to release from the boxes. So I used Cricut scraper to slowly loose the edges. It totally takes me 10 mins to release all of them.</div>

         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Where is my apple stem and leaf?!</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">I noticed my apple stem and leaf was still in the box, but hidden inside the box. It is no way to pull them out.
           Even if I pull them out successfully, it is also impossible to cast the apple stem and leaf later. I realized that the hole fot the stem was 
           too thin to pull the leaf out. It is a great lesson to me.</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">Except for the stem and leaf, everything else is great. It has nicely detail. The registration points can fit 
         together perfectly.</div>

         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Casting preparation</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">I used rubber bands with two cardboards to hold the two boxes together. I also added some color powder to make fun.</div>

         <div class="service-item-text font-bold">Hydrostone</div>
         <div class="service-item-text">I added water into hydrostone and mixed it thoroughly until it looked like yogurt. Then I poured 
         it slowly into the vent hole. The waiting time was around 30 - 50 mins.</div>
