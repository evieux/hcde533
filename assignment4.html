            <div class="service-item-text">After finishing the assembly, I started to level the bed. The aim of bed leveling is to ensure 
              the nozzle is very close to the bed at all four points. To adjust this, I first chose “auto home” from the dial to move 
              the nozzle to [x=0, y=0, z=0] and disabled the steppers to be able to adjust the position of the nozzle by myself manually. 
              Then, I put a piece of letter paper under the nozzle. By tuning the four-wheel screws under the bed, I made sure it could 
              barely move between the nozzle and the bed when moving the nozzle. </div>

            <div class="service-item-text">What I wanted to design is a vase with two holes that have optional addons to hold photos and 
              flowers. I used SubD Tools in Rhino to build the vase and addons. I tried twice to print it out. For the first time, I printed 
              the vase by setting it with the special mode "spiralize outer contour." The thickness is not enough to stick to each line together, 
              so it was loose in the middle of the vase. Then I added the thickness by using the command offsetsrf to increase the thickness to 1.5mm 
              and scale it to 0.9 to get a quicker result. The total print time is 1h19mins. This time it worked out! I'm pretty happy with this result.
